# Command Line Tool

The Pebble SDK includes a command line tool called `pebble`. This tool allows developers to create new projects, build projects, install apps on a watch and debug them.

## Enabling the Developer Connection

Most `pebble` commands allow interaction with a Pebble watch. This relies on a communication channel opened between the `pebble` tool on a computer and the Pebble mobile application on the phone.

The `pebble` tool requires two configuration steps:

1.  Enable the [*Developer Connection*](/guides/tools-and-resources/developer-connection/) in the Pebble mobile application.
2.  Give the phone IP address to the `pebble` tool as shown below to communicate with a watch. This is not required when using the emulator.

## Connecting to a Pebble

There are four connection types possible with the command line tool. These can be used with any command that involves a watch, for example `install`.

Connect to a physical watch connected to a phone on the same Wi-Fi network with `IP` [IP address](#enabling-the-developer-connection):

\$ pebble install --phone IP

Connect to an already running QEMU instance available on the `HOST` and `PORT` provided:

\$ pebble install --qemu HOST:PORT

Connect directly to a watch using a local Bluetooth connection, where `SERIAL` is the path to the device file. On OS X, this is similar to `/dev/cu.PebbleTimeXXXX-SerialPo` or `/dev/cu.PebbleXXXX-SerialPortSe`:

> Note: Replace 'XXXX' with the actual value for the watch in question.

\$ pebble install --serial SERIAL

## Configure the Pebble Tool

Save the IP address of the phone in an environment variable:

\$ export PEBBLE_PHONE=192.168.1.42

Save the default choice of emulator platform:

\$ export PEBBLE_EMULATOR=aplite

Save the default instance of QEMU:

\$ export PEBBLE_QEMU=localhost:12344

## Debugging Output

Get up to four levels of `pebble` tool log verbosity. This is available for all commands:

\# Minimum level of verbosity \$ pebble install -v \# Maximum logging verbosity \$ pebble install -vvvv

## Installing Watchapps

In addition to interacting with a physical Pebble watch, the Pebble emulator included in the local SDK can be used to run and debug apps without any physical hardware.

Build an app, then use `pebble install` with the `--emulator` flag to choose between an emulator platform with `aplite`, `basalt`, or `chalk`. This allows developers to test out apps on all platforms before publishing to the Pebble appstore. For example, to emulate Pebble Time or Pebble Time Steel:

\$ pebble install --emulator basalt

> Note: If no `--emulator` parameter is specified, the running emulator will be used.

With a suitable color app installed, the emulator will load and display it:

![](/assets/images/guides/publishing-tools/emulator.png)

The Pebble physical buttons are emulated with the following mapping:

| Button | Key              |
|--------|------------------|
| Back   | `Q`, left arrow  |
| Up     | `W`, up arrow    |
| Select | `S`, right arrow |
| Down   | `X`, down arrow  |

## Pebble Timeline in the Emulator

With the emulator, it is also possible to view any past and future pins on the Pebble timeline by pressing Up or Down from the main watchface screen:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| ![](/assets/images/guides/publishing-tools/timeline-past.png) | ![](/assets/images/guides/publishing-tools/timeline-future.png) |
| Timeline, past view | Timeline, future view |

## Commands

This section summarizes the available commands that can be used in conjunction with the `pebble` tool, on the applicable SDK versions. Most are designed to interact with a watch with `--phone` or the emulator with `--emulator`.

### Project Management

#### new-project

\$ pebble new-project \[--simple\] \[--javascript\] \[--worker\] \[--rocky\] NAME

Create a new project called `NAME`. This will create a directory in the location the command is used, containing all essential project files.

There are also a number of optional parameters that allow developers to choose features of the generated project to be created automatically:

- `--simple` - Initializes the main `.c` file with a minimal app template.

- `--javascript` - Creates a new application including a `./src/pkjs/index.js` file to quickly start an app with a PebbleKit JS component. Read [*PebbleKit JS*](/guides/communication/using-pebblekit-js/) for more information.

- `--worker` - Creates a new application including a ` ./worker_src/NAME_worker.c` file to quickly start an app with a background worker. Read [*Background Worker*](/guides/events-and-services/background-worker/) for more information.

- `--rocky` - Creates a new Rocky.js application. Do not use any other optional parameters with this command. Read [Rocky.js documentation](/docs/rockyjs/) for more information.

#### build

\$ pebble build

Compile and build the project into a `.pbw` file that can be installed on a watch or the emulator.

#### install

\$ pebble install \[FILE\]

Install the current project to the watch connected to the phone with the given `IP` address, or to the emulator on the `PLATFORM`. See [*Hardware Information*](/guides/tools-and-resources/hardware-information/) for a list of available platforms.

For example, the Aplite platform is specified as follows:

\$ pebble install --emulator aplite

It is also possible to use this command to install a pre-compiled `.pbw` `FILE`. In this case, the specified file will be installed instead of the current project.

> Note: A `FILE` parameter is not required if running `pebble install` from inside a buildable project directory. In this case, the `.pbw` package is found automatically in `./build`.

#### clean

\$ pebble clean

Delete all build files in `./build` to prepare for a clean build, which can resolve some state inconsistencies that may prevent the project from building.

#### convert-project

\$ pebble convert-project

Convert an existing Pebble project to the current SDK.

> Note: This will only convert the project, the source code will still have to updated to match any new APIs.

### Pebble Interaction

#### logs

\$ pebble logs

Continuously display app logs from the watch connected to the phone with the given `IP` address, or from a running emulator.

App log output is colorized according to log level. This behavior can be forced on or off by specifying `--color` or `--no-color` respectively.

#### screenshot

\$ pebble screenshot \[FILENAME\]

Take a screenshot of the watch connected to the phone with the given `IP` address, or from any running emulator. If provided, the output is saved to `FILENAME`.

Color correction may be disabled by specifying `--no-correction`. The auto-opening of screenshots may also be disabled by specifying `--no-open`.

#### ping

\$ pebble ping

Send a `ping` to the watch connected to the phone with the given `IP` address, or to any running emulator.

#### repl

\$ pebble repl

Launch an interactive python shell with a `pebble` object to execute methods on, using the watch connected to the phone with the given `IP` address, or to any running emulator.

#### data-logging

##### list

\$ pebble data-logging list

List the current data logging sessions on the watch.

##### download

\$ pebble data-logging download --session-id SESSION-ID FILENAME

Downloads the contents of the data logging session with the given ID (as given by `pebble data-logging list`) to the given filename.

##### disable-sends

pebble data-logging disable-sends

Disables automatically sending data logging to the phone. This enables downloading data logging information without the phone's interference. It will also suspend any other app depending on data logging, which includes some firmware functionality. You should remember to enable it once you are done testing.

##### enable-sends

pebble data-logging enable-sends

Re-enables automatically sending data logging information to the phone.

##### get-sends-enabled

pebble data-logging get-sends-enabled

Indicates whether data logging is automatically sent to the phone. Change state with `enable-sends` and `disable-sends`.

### Emulator Interaction

#### gdb

\$ pebble gdb

Use [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) to step through and debug an app running in an emulator. Some useful commands are displayed in a cheat sheet when run with `--help` and summarized in the table below:

> Note: Emulator commands that rely on interaction with the emulator (e.g. `emu-app-config`) will not work while execution is paused with GDB.

[TABLE]

Read [*Debugging with GDB*](/guides/debugging/debugging-with-gdb/) for help on using GDB to debug app.

#### emu-control

\$ pebble emu-control \[--port PORT\]

Send near real-time accelerometer and compass readings from a phone, tablet, or computer to the emulator. When run, a QR code will be displayed in the terminal containing the IP address the device should connect to. Scanning the code will open this address in the device's browser. The IP address itself is also printed in the terminal for manual entry. `PORT` may be specified in order to make bookmarking the page easier.

![qr-code](/assets/images/guides/publishing-tools/qr-code.png)

After connecting, the device's browser will display a UI with two modes of operation.

![accel-ui](/assets/images/guides/publishing-tools/accel-ui.png)

The default mode will transmit sensor readings to the emulator as they are recorded. By unchecking the 'Use built-in sensors?' checkbox, manual values for the compass bearing and each of the accelerometer axes can be transmitted to the emulator by manipulating the compass rose or axis sliders. Using these UI elements will automatically uncheck the aforementioned checkbox.

The values shown in bold are the Pebble SDK values, scaled relative to [`TRIG_MAX_ANGLE`](/docs/c/Foundation/Math/#TRIG_MAX_ANGLE "TRIG_MAX_ANGLE") in the case of the compass bearing value, and in the range of +/-4000 (+/- 4g) for the accelerometer values. The physical measurements with associated units are shown beside in parentheses.

#### emu-app-config

\$ pebble emu-app-config \[--file FILE\]

Open the app configuration page associated with the running app, if any. Uses the HTML configuration `FILE` if provided.

See [*App Configuration*](/guides/user-interfaces/app-configuration/) to learn about emulator- specific configuration behavior.

#### emu-tap

\$ pebble emu-tap \[--direction DIRECTION\]

Send an accelerometer tap event to any running emulator. `DIRECTION` can be one of `x+`, `x-`, `y+`, `y-`, `z+`, or `z-`.

#### emu-bt-connection

\$ pebble emu-bt-connection --connected STATE

Send a Bluetooth connection event to any running emulator. `STATE` can be either `yes` or `no` for connected and disconnected events respectively.

> Note: The disconnected event may take a few seconds to occur.

#### emu-compass

\$ pebble emu-compass --heading BEARING \[--uncalibrated \| --calibrating \| --calibrated\]

Send a compass update event to any running emulator. `BEARING` must be a number between `0` and `360` to be the desired compass bearing. Use any of `--uncalibrated`, `--calibrating`, or `--calibrated` to set the calibration state.

#### emu-battery

\$ pebble emu-battery \[--percent LEVEL\] \[--charging\]

Send a battery update event to any running emulator. `LEVEL` must be a number between `0` and `100` to represent the new battery level. The presence of `--charging` will determine whether the charging cable is plugged in.

#### emu-accel

\$ pebble emu-accel DIRECTION \[--file FILE\]

Send accelerometer data events to any running emulator. `DIRECTION` can be any of `tilt_left`, `tilt_right`, `tilt_forward`, `tilt_back`, `gravity+x`, `gravity-x`, `gravity+y`, `gravity-y`, `gravity+z`, `gravity-z` , and `custom`. If `custom` is selected, specify a `FILE` of comma-separated x, y, and z readings.

#### transcribe

\$ pebble transcribe \[message\] \[--error {connectivity,disabled,no-speech-detected}\]

Run a server that will act as a transcription service. Run it before invoking the [`Dictation`](/docs/c/Foundation/Dictation/ "Dictation") service in an app. If `message` is provided, the dictation will be successful and that message will be provided. If `--error` is provided, the dictation will fail with the given error. `--error` and `message` are mutually exclusive.

\$ pebble transcribe "Hello, Pebble!"

#### kill

\$ pebble kill

Kill both the Pebble emulator and phone simulator.

#### emu-time-format

pebble emu-time-format --format FORMAT

Set the time format of the emulator to either 12-hour or 24-hour format, with a `FORMAT` value of `12h` or `24h` respectively.

#### emu-set-timeline-quick-view

\$ pebble emu-set-timeline-quick-view STATE

Show or hide the Timeline Quick View system overlay. STATE can be `on` or `off`.

#### wipe

\$ pebble wipe

Wipe data stored for the Pebble emulator, but not the logged in Pebble account. To wipe **all** data, specify `--everything` when running this command.

### Pebble Account Management

#### login

\$ pebble login

Launces a browser to log into a Pebble account, enabling use of `pebble` tool features such as pushing timeline pins.

#### logout

\$ pebble logout

Logs out the currently logged in Pebble account from this instance of the command line tool.

### Pebble Timeline Interaction

#### insert-pin

\$ pebble insert-pin FILE \[--id ID\]

Push a JSON pin `FILE` to the Pebble timeline. Specify the pin `id` in the `FILE` as `ID`.

#### delete-pin

\$ pebble delete-pin FILE \[--id ID\]

Delete a pin previously pushed with `insert-pin`, specifying the same pin `ID`.

## Data Collection for Analytics

When first run, the `pebble` tool will ask for permission to collect usage information such as which tools are used and the most common errors. Nothing personally identifiable is collected.

This information will help us improve the SDK and is extremely useful for us, allowing us to focus our time on the most important parts of the SDK as discovered through these analytics.

To disable analytics collection, run the following command to stop sending information:

\# Mac OSX \$ touch ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Pebble\\ SDK/NO_TRACKING \# Other platforms \$ touch ~/.pebble-sdk/NO_TRACKING
